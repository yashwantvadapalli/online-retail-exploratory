# Online Retail Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

## Overview

In this project, I am stepping into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at an online retail company, where I will interpret real-world data to help make a key business decision.

## Case Study

In this project, I am working with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset includes information about customer purchases, encompassing product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. My objective is to explore and analyze this dataset to extract insights about the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products.

By conducting exploratory data analysis, I'll identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data. This will enable me to make informed, data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and enhance customer satisfaction. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, I will uncover key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers. Ultimately, my goal in this project is to provide actionable insights that can inform strategic business decisions and boost the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.

## Prerequisites

Before I start this project, I need to have a basic understanding of Python programming and Pandas. Additionally, I may use the following packages in my Python environment:

    pandas
    numpy
    seaborn
    matplotlib

These packages should already be installed in Coursera's Jupyter Notebook environment. However, if I need to install additional packages that are not included in this environment or if I am working off-platform, I can install additional packages using !pip install packagename within a notebook cell, like:

    !pip install pandas
    !pip install matplotlib
    !pip install --upgrade seaborn


## Project Objectives
1. Describe data to answer key questions to uncover insights
2. Gain valuable insights that will help improve online retail performance
3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations


## Dataset

The dataset I will be working with is the "Online Retail" dataset. It comprises transactional data from an online retail store covering the period from 2010 to 2011. The dataset is available in a .xlsx file named Online Retail.xlsx. This file is already included in the Coursera Jupyter Notebook environment, but if I'm working off-platform, it can also be downloaded here.

The dataset includes the following columns:

    InvoiceNo: The invoice number of the transaction.
    StockCode: The unique code of the product.
    Description: The description of the product.
    Quantity: The quantity of the product in the transaction.
    InvoiceDate: The date and time of the transaction.
    UnitPrice: The unit price of the product.
    CustomerID: The unique identifier of the customer.
    Country: The country where the transaction occurred.
